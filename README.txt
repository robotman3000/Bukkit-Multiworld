# Spigot-Plus
Any improvements are welcome, especially improvements to speed and efficiency.
This plugin intends to be an all in one alternative for MultiVerse, PerWorldInventory, CreativeGates, and several other plugins.
Note that the aforementioned plugins are good plugins but for my purposes they weren't suable either from lack of maintenance, missing features, or just not fitting my requirements/use case. There may also be a bit of "I want to do it all by myself" mixed in.
At any rate my plugin is on github in the hopes that others may find it to be useful. As far as features go, any given feature or bug will be fixed or added as it becomes needed for the plugin to continue to meet my requirements. Lastly this plugin was developed and tested to mix nicely with WorldEdit, CraftBook, CommandBook, WorldGuard, PermissionsEX, and ModifyWorld.
